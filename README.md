## Major projects

### E-commerce application for a Japanese Retailer (Node.js, Angular, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, Jenkins)

- The project intends to build microservices for various cart management activities like adding products, updating products, removing products, and the order value calculation. The microservices include the cart module responsible for managing the cart, an order module for processing the user orders and returns, a price module for calculating the price updates, a payment module for communicating with the payment gateways, and an account module for storing all the user details.
- Involved in implementation of procedures for gathering the requirements from clients for solution demonstrations.
- Integrated Jenkins to git where the build triggers automatically when we push a pull request for CI/CD.
- Worked on CI/CD tool Jenkins to automate the build process from version control tool into testing and production environment.

### JSP to Angular migration (Angular, Java)

- Collaborated with team members to offer accurate and timely estimates for development solutions.
- Managed different, sometimes conflicting priorities and responsibilities within a work team.
